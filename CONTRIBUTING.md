# Contributing to Engineering Emergence Verification

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## Project Scope

This project focuses on:
1. **Verification** of the Engineering Emergence framework (Jansma & Hoel, 2025)
2. **Documentation** of the cycle length discovery
3. **Reproducibility** of computational results

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find discrepancies in the verification or have questions:

1. Check existing issues first
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - System information (Python version, OS, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

For new features or extensions:

1. Open an issue describing:
   - The enhancement goal
   - How it relates to the original paper or discovery
   - Implementation approach (if applicable)

### Code Contributions

**Before submitting:**

1. **Maintain Standards:**
   - Follow existing code structure
   - Include standard headers in new files
   - Add docstrings for functions
   - Keep academic rigor (cite sources, document assumptions)

2. **Testing:**
   - Verify your changes don't break existing results
   - Include checksums for reproducibility
   - Test on Python 3.10+

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update relevant .md files
   - Add entries to CHANGELOG.md
   - Include comments explaining non-obvious logic

**Pull Request Process:**

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)
3. Commit with clear messages
4. Push to your fork
5. Open a Pull Request with description of changes

## Research Extensions

If you're building on the cycle length discovery:

- **Please cite both:**
  - Original paper: Jansma & Hoel (2025)
  - This verification: See CITATION.cff

- **Share findings:**
  - Open an issue to discuss
  - Link to your work
  - We'll add to references if relevant

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on scientific accuracy
- Credit all sources appropriately
- Maintain academic integrity

## Questions?

Open an issue or contact:

**Note:** This is a verification and research project. Major changes should maintain alignment with the original Engineering Emergence framework while clearly documenting any extensions or modifications.
